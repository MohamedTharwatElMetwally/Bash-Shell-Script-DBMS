Notes
- The Database will be stored as a Directory on Current Script File
- Ask about columns datatypes in create table and check on them in both insert and update
- Ask about primary key in create table and check for it in the insert into table







for each table:
----------------

1- metadata

field_name:datatype:pk:required
field_name:datatype:pk:required
field_name:datatype:pk:required

datatype ==> string or int
pk ==> 0 or 1
required ==> 0 or 1


2- data

field_name:field_name:field_name
value:value:value
value:value:value
value:value:value



Naming Rules:
-------------
database ===> .db
tables ===> .tbl
metadata ===> .meta


Regex:
------
^[a-zA-Z]+[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$

1- Columns: Make sure the column name does not already exist.
2- Columns: Make sure the Primary key is selected by the user, and if the user has already chosen a primary key, they don't get asked again for it.
3- Tables: Make sure the table does not already exist.
